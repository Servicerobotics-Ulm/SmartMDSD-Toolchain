The SmartMDSD Toolchain v3 requires Java: OpenJDK 8 (deb package "openjdk-8-jdk" in Ubuntu) as the only strict dependency.

Eclipse installation instructions (assuming that Ubuntu and Java were installed):

1. Download the default Eclipse (OOMPH) installer (this is the default download option):

http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

2. Extract and execute installer and select "Advanced Mode":

- select "Eclipse Modeling Tools" as the package and "2019-12" as the Eclipse Version, press "Next"
- select one of the provided custom Installer Configuration setups:
-- (a) org.smartmdsd.infrastructure/org.smartmdsd.installer/SmartMDSD.github.setup (if you want to change the Eclipse Plugins)
-- (b) org.smartmdsd.infrastructure/org.smartmdsd.installer/SmartMDSD.runtime.setup (if you want to develop Robotics Components and Systems)
