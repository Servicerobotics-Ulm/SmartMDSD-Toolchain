The SmartMDSD Toolchain V3 requires the following default development environment:

- OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Java: OpenJDK 8 (deb package "openjdk-8-jdk")
- Eclipse: Oxygen (Modeling Tools)
 (Sirius ver. 5.x and Xtext ver. 2.x)


Eclipse installation instructions (assuming that Ubuntu and Java were installed):

1. Download Eclipse Oxygen installer (this is the default download option):

http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

2. Extract and execute installer and select "Eclipse Modeling Tools" (follow the installation instructions)

3. Launch installed Eclipse instance and select a (new) workspace of your choice

4. Within Eclipse select the menu: "Help" -> "Install Modeling Components"
  - in the popup dialog, select: Sirius and Xtext
  - press the "Finish" button and follow the installation instructions
  - during installation, accept license windows 
  - after installation, accept popup dialog to restart eclipse

5. Configure the (default) JRE to be used for the new workspace:
  - select menu: "Window" -> "Preferences"
  - in the popup window select: "Java" -> "Installed JREs"
  - if the list does not yet have the openjdk8 included then push the "Add..." button
  - select "Standard VM" and push "Next"
  - select the JRE home directory, typically: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
  - normally all the other fields should be recognised automatically, if so, push "Finish"
  - push "Apply and Close" button of the "Preferences" window 

6. Import the plugin projects from this repository into the new Eclipse instance
  - select menu: "File" -> "Import..."
  - in the popup window select: "General" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace" and push "Next" button
  - push the "Browse..." button and select the root folder from this repository checkout

7. It is recommended to use "working sets" (which makes life easier) according to the folder structure in the repository
