<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<p>This file contains the release notes for the SmartMDSD Toolchain version 3.x. For each release, it provides important information to users to support them in switching from one specific version the previous version. This includes information and instructions how to migrate content from one version to another.</p>

<h2>v3.9</h2>

<p>This release provides a <strong>major User Interface (UI) update</strong>. While the old UI still can be used as before, it is considered deprecated as of this release, and it will be removed in one of the following releases as soon as the new UI has been proved to be stable and robust enough in the field. While the new UI has cleaned-up and harmonized all the context menus and commands, the basic functionality is still there and for the existing projects no major changes are required (besides of adding a new project nature as described below). You can also continue to use your existing workspaces. In order to use the full power of the new UI, you just have to configure one of the <strong>new SmartMDSD project natures</strong> for each of your existing projects. In this release, four dedicated project natures exist: DomainModels -, Component -, Behavior -, and System Project Nature. You can configure one of these natures as follows:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Right-click on your project</strong> within the Model Explorer window (typically located on the upper-left)
2) Select the context menu <strong>Configure</strong>
3) Now click on one of the new commands, depending on your currently selected project type:
- For DomainModels projects select: <strong>Configure SmartMDSDS DomainModels nature...</strong>
- For Component projects select: <strong>Configure SmartMDSDS Component nature...</strong>
- For Behavior projects select: <strong>Configure SmartMDSDS Behavior nature...</strong>
- For System projects select: <strong>Configure SmartMDSDS System nature...</strong></p>

<p>Please note that you can revert this step at any time. After having configured one of these natures, the previous configure command changes automatically from "<strong>Configure</strong> SmartMDSD ..." to "<strong>Remove</strong> SmartMDSD ...". Naturally, by selecting one of the "Remove" commands the project nature gets removed from that project. Please also note that all the new features of the new UI will first be usable if you have configured one of SmartMDSD project natures.</p>

<p>Now, the next step to do is to open one of the four <strong>new Eclipse Perspectives</strong>. Each of these perspectives reconfigures the visible windows and context menus depending on your current task to do. In this release, the following perspectives are realized for the four core <strong>RobMoSys developer roles</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Expert (Tier 2)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Component Supplier (Tier 3)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Behavior Developer (Tier 3)</strong></li>
<li><strong>System Builder (Tier 3)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on the RobMoSys roles, please check the <strong>RobMoSys Technical Wiki</strong>: https://robmosys.eu/wiki/general_principles:ecosystem:roles</p>

<p>If you haven't opened these perspective before, you can do so as follows:</p>

<p>1) Select Eclipse menu: <strong>Window</strong> -> <strong>Perspective</strong> -> <strong>Open Perspective</strong> -> <strong>Other...</strong>
2) A new popup window named "Open Perspective" should show up; here you can select one of the new perspectives named after the respective RobMoSys role (see above) 
3) Finally, push the <strong>Open</strong> button</p>

<p>You will immediately notice that the "Model Explorer" on the left is exchanged by the new <strong>SmartMDSD Project Explorer</strong>, which is specifically configured for each of the RobMoSys roles and by default, you will only see related projects (depending on their configured project nature). Moreover, you will see new context menus and the arrangement of the visible windows will change if you switch between the different perspectives. After you have opened each of the new perspectives once, a shortcut for each of them will be visible on the upper right corner of the Eclipse main window and you can easily switch between them. Please note, you can always go back to the default "Modeling" perspective in case you either want to use the old menus, or in case you need to open some old projects (created with one of the preceding SmartMDSD Toolchain releases) that do not yet have one of the new project natures configured.</p>

<p>Another improvement in the UI is related to building (i.e. compiling) the projects. In the previous versions there were two commands, CMake and Make that had to be called manually in the right order. In the new UI these two commands have been combined into one build command which now is even integrated into the overall Eclipse build infrastructure. This means that a project can now be built simply by using the standard Eclipse menu: <strong>Project</strong> -> <strong>Build Project</strong> (or <strong>Build All</strong> to build all projects in the current workspace). Analogously, the standard menu: <strong>Project</strong> -> <strong>Clean...</strong> will clean the selected projects.</p>

<p>This release provides the integration of robotics behavior development into the SmartMDSD Toolchain.
This includes so far the following parts: Behavior Task Level modeling, with dedicated projects. Behavior Skill level modeling with dedicated tooling associated to the role of the Component Supplier. The modeling of skill and behavior task interfaces associated to the role of the Domain Experts. The modeling and realization of Behavior Coordination Interfaces and Services which are used by coordination components (Sequencer).</p>

<h2>v3.8</h2>

<p>This release does not involve any changes for the existing projects created with the previous SmartMDSD Toolchain v3.7.</p>

<h2>v3.7</h2>

<ul>
<li>In previous versions of the Toolchain, the Java Classpath of each project required a dependency to two libraries
<ul>
<li>ECLIPSE<em>HOME/plugins/org.xtext.base.stateMachine</em>3.4.0.jar</li>
<li>ECLIPSE<em>HOME/plugins/org.xtext.service.parameterDefinition</em>3.4.0.jar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Since version 3.7 these libraries do not exists anymore. If you have an old project please remove these library dependencies from your project's java classpath. You can do this either by opening the project properties in Eclipse (right click on the project within the Project Explorer, select <strong>Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries</strong> and delete the conflicting dependencies here). Or just open the hidden <strong>.classpath</strong> file in the project folder and delete the two classpath entries mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>It is now recommended to deactivate the global (automatic) C++ indexer, which will consume all your memory for projects with heavy dependencies (such as e.g. ROS). You can still trigger the indexer for individual projects manually, but do not activate the automatic indexer update.</p>

<ul>
<li>To deactivate the automatic indexer for your workspace, go to <strong>Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Indexer</strong> and <strong>deactivate the option "Automatically update the index"</strong> (this option is highlighted with black color for a reason as it seems to be an evil option ;-)).</li>
<li>To manually trigger the C++ indexer for your project, <strong>right-click on your project</strong> within the project explorer and select <strong>Index -> Rebuild</strong>.
If you used the new Eclipse Installer to install the SmartMDSD Toolchain, then the global index update should be automatically deactivated by default.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
